Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. Project Setup
  A. Set up Django backend

    - $ python -m venv venv
    - $ source venv/bin/activate
      - $ deactivate
    - $ pip install django djangorestframework
    - $ python manage.py migrate
    - $ python manage.py runserver

  B. Set up frontend, served via Next.js
    - the drill

  C. Test - configure backend/frontend communication (API setup)
    - create a secure connection to Django server
    - create and use a test route in/for backend/frontend communication

2. Backend (Django) Development
  A. Create Django models for trips & logs
    - This step continues as I discover more about keeping locations in a database
      - Location model is a compact entity that holds geolocation, associated name and stop type together, they could be separated for a more long lasting db

  B. Build API endpoints for trip and logbook
    - Used djangorestframework (DRF) to create the boilerplate code. Otherwise would have to:
        - Manual Serialization: You have to manually convert model instances to JSON and back.
        - Handling HTTP Methods: For each HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), you need to write separate logic to handle those.
        - Views and URLs: You manage views and their URL mappings manually, without the abstraction provided by ViewSets and routers in DRF.

  C. Integrate a routing API (Google Maps, OpenRouteService, or Mapbox)
    - Simple Map Operations created using Leaflet and various free APIs

  D. Implement Hours of Service (HOS) compliance logic
    - Should I write probability functions and auto-create logbooks, make it less efficient, or defy orders
      - Yo it's an interview assignment 

  E. Implement Geolocation service for "address -> lat, lon" conversion
    - Done

3. Frontend (React) Development
  A. Build input form (current location, pickup, drop-off, cycle hours)
    - Done

  B. Display route on a map (Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or Google Maps API)

  C. Connect the interface with backend securely

  D. Implement ELD log drawing (Canvas or Chart.js)
    -Done

4. UI/UX Enhancements
Improve form validation & user experience
Style the app for better aesthetics

5. Deployment
Deploy Django backend (Render/Railway)
Deploy React frontend (Vercel)
Connect frontend to live backend

6. Testing & Debugging
Verify API responses & calculations
Check UI responsiveness & usability

7. Loom Video & Submission
Record a 3-5 min Loom video walkthrough
Upload project to GitHub & share links 


notes:

  - Alive

- APIs
  - overpass for searching "fuel" stations
  - geoapify for
    - autocomplete: geolocation search via a keyword
    - routing: route data between locations

- general
  - lots of web app functions for ease of use distributed to different views

- önemli not
  - Project is deployed on Render.com, it is a free instance therefore shuts down due to inactivity, one may have to wait 50 seconds until it spins up and sends its first response 

- ekleyebilirim

  - add trip
 	  - harita, tıklama ile (current, pickup, dropoff seçenekleriyle) seçip yaklaşabilir
  
  - trip view
    - changing stops according to authentication role, role gates
    - mobile frontend should reconfigure table displays
      - Don't show every stop for a trip, maybe only start pickup and end
  
  - logbook view
    - mobile Frontend

  - logbook edit
     - should reconfigure displays

  - general
    - create dark mode
	  - Plaka takibi
	  - sürücü takibi
 	  - yakıt hesabı Litre bazında
